                    <p>My favorite part of development is showing a client a work in progress. That's the time when we get the best feedback. From there, we are able to make the design or app even better. The Internettes are all about happy clients and awesome development!</p>

                    <p>Although I cannot relate to Spider-Man in a complete literal sense, we have a lot in common figuratively. I desire to "leap tall buildings" with my development. Most importantly, I desire to rescue those in need of help. Whether that help is a complete make over for a website or the development of a website from the ground up, the success of someone else based on work that I have accomplished makes my day's work a job well done. Without letting my colorful metaphor take away from my seriousness, I am lucky to be working with a team as knowledgeable and passionate about their career as I am.</p>

                    <p>My career has taken me in many different paths, and introduced me to many different people. I'm a former military brat who got a taste for travel at an early age. I'm married to my lovely wife, Andrea, and we have a rescue dog at home. I'm a fan of the (2014 NBA Champions) San Antonio Spurs. I also regularly host pub quizzes. I've discovered a passion for coding, and would love to share it with you!</p>
